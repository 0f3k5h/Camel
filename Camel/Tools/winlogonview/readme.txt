Description
===========

WinLogOnView is a simple tool for Windows Vista/7/8/2008 that analyses
the security event log of Windows operating system, and detects the
date/time that users logged on and logged off. For every time that a user
log on/log off to your system, the following information is displayed:
Logon ID, User Name, Domain, Computer, Logon Time, Logoff Time, Duration,
and network address.
WinLogOnView also allows you to easily export the logon sessions
information to tab-delimited/comma-delimited/html/xml file.



System Requirements
===================


* This utility works on Windows Vista/7/8/2008/10. Both 32-bit and
  64-bit systems are supported. On Windows 10 April Update (1803) you
  have to turn on the 'Use New Event Log API' option. Older systems are
  not supported because the log on/log off information is not added to
  the security event log.



Known Limitations
=================


* This tool is based on the security event log of Windows, and the
  accuracy of the displayed information depends on the availability and
  accuracy of the data stored inside the security event log. It's
  possible that some of the information will be missing, like a logon
  session without logoff time. Bw aware that WinLogOnView currently uses
  the following events: 4648 (Logon), 4647 (LogOff), 4624 (Logon), 4800
  (Workstation lock).

Start Using WinLogOnView
========================

WinLogOnView doesn't require any installation process or additional dll
files. In order to start using it, simply run the executable file -
WinLogOnView.exe
After running it, the main window of WinLogOnView displays the list of
all logon sessions detected on your system. You can easily export the
list to html/xml/tab-delimited/comma-delimited file by using the 'Save
Selected Items' option. You can also copy the selected items to the
clipboard (Ctrl+C) and then paste them into Excel with Ctrl+V.

If you want to get the logon/logoff information of a remote computer on
your network, simply go to the Advanced Options window (F9), choose
'Remote Computer' as data source, and then type the name of the remote
computer to connect.
If you want to get the logon/logoff information from external disk,
simply choose 'External Disk' as data source and then type the path of
the event log (Usually located under C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs)



Command-Line Options

/Source <1-3>
Specifies the type of data source. 1 = Local Computer, 2 = Remote
Computer, 3 = External Disk

/Server <Remote Computer>
Specifies the remote computer to load. (For using with /Source 2 )

/ExternalFolder <Folder>
Specifies the folder in external disk to load. (For using with /Source 3 )

/stext <Filename>
Save the list of all logon sessions into a regular text file.

/stab <Filename>
Save the list of all logon sessions into a tab-delimited text file.

/scomma <Filename>

(csv).

/stabular <Filename>

/sverhtml <Filename>

/sxml <Filename>

/sort <column>
This command-line option can be used with other save options for sorting
by the desired column. If you don't specify this option, the list is
sorted according to the last sort that you made from the user interface.
The <column> parameter can specify the column index (0 for the first
column, 1 for the second column, and so on) or the name of the column,
like "User Name" and "Logon Time". You can specify the '~' prefix
character (e.g: "~User Name") if you want to sort in descending order.
You can put multiple /sort in the command-line if you want to sort by
multiple columns.

Examples:
WinLogOnView.exe /shtml "f:\temp\logon.html" /sort 2 /sort ~1
WinLogOnView.exe /shtml "f:\temp\logon.html" /sort "User Name" /sort
"Logon Time"

/nosort
When you specify this command-line option, the list will be saved without
any sorting.

instructions below:
1. Run WinLogOnView with /savelangfile parameter:
