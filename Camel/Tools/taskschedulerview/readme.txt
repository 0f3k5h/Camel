Start Using TaskSchedulerView
=============================

TaskSchedulerView doesn't require any installation process or additional
DLL files. In order to start using it, simply run the executable file -
TaskSchedulerView.exe

cannot be accessed without full administrator privileges. In order to
view all tasks, you can easily run TaskSchedulerView as Administrator by
pressing Ctrl+F11.
Inside the main window of TaskSchedulerView, you can easily select one or
more tasks, and then export them to
text/comma-delimited/tab-delimited/html/xml file (By using the 'Save
Selected Items' option) or copy the selected tasks to the clipboard and
