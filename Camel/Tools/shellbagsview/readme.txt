Description
===========

Each time that you open a folder in Explorer, Windows automatically save
the settings of this folder into the Registry. This utility displays the
list of all folder settings saved by Windows. For each folder, the
following information is displayed: The date/time that you opened it, the
entry number, display mode (Details, Icons, Tiles, and so on...), the
last position of the window, and the last size of the window.

Using ShellBagsView
===================

ShellBagsView doesn't require any installation process or additional DLL
files. In order to start using it, simply run the executable file -
ShellBagsView.exe
After running it, the main window of ShellBagsView displays the list of
all folder entries in your system.



Command-Line Options
====================



/stext <Filename>
Save the list of folders into a regular text file.

/stab <Filename>
Save the list of folders into a tab-delimited text file.

/scomma <Filename>
Save the list of folders into a comma-delimited text file.

/stabular <Filename>
Save the list of folders into a tabular text file.

/shtml <Filename>
Save the list of folders into HTML file (Horizontal).

/sverhtml <Filename>
Save the list of folders into HTML file (Vertical).

/sxml <Filename>
Save the list of folders to XML file.

/sort <column>
This command-line option can be used with other save options for sorting
by the desired column. If you don't specify this option, the list is
sorted according to the last sort that you made from the user interface.
The <column> parameter can specify the column index (0 for the first
column, 1 for the second column, and so on) or the name of the column,
like "Path" and "Last Modified Time". You can specify the '~' prefix
character (e.g: "~Last Modified Time") if you want to sort in descending
order. You can put multiple /sort in the command-line if you want to sort
by multiple columns.

Examples:
ShellBagsView.exe.exe /shtml "f:\temp\history.html" /sort 2 /sort ~1
ShellBagsView.exe.exe /shtml "f:\temp\history.html" /sort "Last Modified
Time"

/nosort
When you specify this command-line option, the list will be saved without
any sorting.



Translating ShellBagsView to other languages
============================================

In order to translate ShellBagsView to other language, follow the
instructions below:
1. Run ShellBagsView with /savelangfile parameter:
   ShellBagsView.exe /savelangfile
   A file named ShellBagsView_lng.ini will be created in the folder of
   ShellBagsView utility.
2. Open the created language file in Notepad or in any other text
   editor.

   you can also add your name and/or a link to your Web site.

   it'll be used in the 'About' window.
4. After you finish the translation, Run ShellBagsView, and all
   translated strings will be loaded from the language file.
